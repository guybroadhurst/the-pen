# The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword 
Simple site based around the quote "The pen is mightier than the sword."

Homework project for the first week on the [SuperHi Foundation](https://superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) course. This site is in essence the same as the main project on this week's lesson, [Sally Hart Portfolio}(https://github.com/guybroadhurst/sally-hart-portfolio).

Designed by UK based digital designer Luke Willett, who put together a typography driven design inspired by words from Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Itâ€™s a very striking design that uses svg (web vector format) images that give it crisp vector quality sharpness.
